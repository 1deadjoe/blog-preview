## Overview

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- [Solution URL](https://github.com/1deadjoe/blog-preview.git)
- [Live Site URL](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I got around using CSS flexbox better. However, I have a problem aligning the text and avatar image along a common baseline.
I also understood pseudo classes while creating styles for hover and active states.

```css
h2 a:hover{
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
h2 a:active{
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued development

I still have a long way to go before I can have full command of flexbox and I am working toward that. 

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css) - This helped me understang the flexbox
- [W3C Markup Validate](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file) - This site helped me check for proper semantics use in my html.
